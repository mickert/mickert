# Hi, I'm Michel 👋

I work on full‑stack projects and small automation tools. Most of my focus goes into making things clear, reliable, and easy to maintain - whether it's a web app, a script, or a deployment fix.

## 🛠️ What I work with

### Languages & Frameworks
- C#, TypeScript, Node.js, Python 
- POSIX‑compliant Bash/dash  
- PowerShell (Windows Server)  
- SQL  
- Regex‑driven scripting

### Areas of interest
- Workflow automation  
- Systemd and Linux admin tooling  
- DNS safety and domain parsing  
- Full‑stack development with an eye for clean structure

## 🚀 Current Projects

### Firewall DNS Automation
A set of scripts and helpers for managing DNS‑related firewall automation.  
Includes config/state separation, structured logging, trimmed stack traces, and safer helper functions.

### IMAP Sender Report
A small reporting tool with a clear README, optional `--note` support for CHANGELOG entries, and simple configuration.

### Defender Family Bulk‑Dismiss Scripts
Regex‑based automation for clearing Microsoft Defender Family phishing alerts.  
Includes adaptive backoff and a test‑only mode for UI‑change resilience.

## 📄 Gists

I use GitHub Gists for small scripts and fixes that don’t need a full repository.

- **[defender-family-bulk-dismiss-alerts.js](https://gist.github.com/mickert/acb16e532d1cb37ae7ffa89f34fa29b0)**  
  A DevTools script that bulk‑dismisses Microsoft Defender Family phishing alerts.  
  - Works with Dutch and English UI  
  - Uses regex matching to stay stable across UI changes  
  - Includes adaptive backoff to avoid rate limits

- **[directus-app.js](https://gist.github.com/mickert/786a03707de3eaaee3b34a350409fb6d)**  
  A deployment patch for Directus 9.9–10+ on IIS, IISNode, Passenger (Plesk), and named‑pipe environments.  
  - Fixes `./server` export regression and `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT`  
  - Filters noisy DEP0005 deprecation warnings (IISNode)  
  - Includes patched `startServer()` logic for named‑pipe support  
  - Based on a community workaround with upstream references

## 🎧 Outside of code

I collect vinyl - especially older or unusual releases - and enjoy exploring how different genres influence each other.
