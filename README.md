# Hi, I'm Michel 👋

I work on full-stack projects and small automation tools. Most of my focus goes into making things clear, reliable, and easy to maintain - whether it's a web app, a script, or a deployment fix.

## 🛠️ What I work with

### Languages & Frameworks
- C#, TypeScript, JS, Node.js, Python 
- POSIX-compliant Bash/dash  
- PowerShell (Windows Server)  
- SQL  
- Regex-driven scripting

### Areas of interest
- Workflow automation  
- Systemd and Linux admin tooling  
- DNS safety and domain parsing  
- Full-stack development with an eye for clean structure

## 🎧 Outside of code

I collect vinyl - especially older or unusual releases - and enjoy exploring how different genres influence each other.
